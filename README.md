# Breast Cancer Detection using Machine Learning

# What is Breast Cancer?
Breast cancer occurs when abnormal cells in the breast grow and divide uncontrollably, often forming a tumor. While it is more common in women, men can also be affected. If untreated, the cancer can spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body, often through the lymphatic system.

Globally, breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in women and a major cause of cancer-related deaths. Early detection plays a crucial role in improving survival rates.
